I am glad you are here! Allow me to introduce myself.

I am currently a student at University of California San Diego and an officer in the engineering club Project in a Box. I am full time student, graduating Spring 2023 with a Bachelor's of Science in Math Computer Science, but I am excited to get involved in the industry and developed new skills. I greatly enjoy problem solving, and thrive when I challenge myself to step out of my comfort zone: academically, professionally and intellectually. 

Outside of my course material, my niche computer science interests are machine learning, data manipulation through Pandas in Google Colab and pathfinding algorithms. Some of my projects can be viewed here:

- **Machine Learning**: 
- **App Development**: 
- **Pathfinding**:
- **3D Computer Graphics Visual Studio**:

When I am not studying or working on projects and assignments, I enjoy cooking with my family, taking a walk on the beach and going for a swim or reading interesting books about history, philosophy, and political economy.
